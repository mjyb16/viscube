# VisCube

## Welcome to the documentation pages for VisCube!

VisCube is a visibility-space gridder for radio interferometry datasets. It has several powerful features:

1. Can handle both single-channel/continuum and multi-frequency/spectral cube datasets
2. Statistically robust uncertainty estimation in the UV plane (for details, see [here](https://viscube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/statistics.html)
3. Built natively in Python using numpy
